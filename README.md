# Abstract:
Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) is a frame-work  that  integrates  multi-dimensional  information  for  a  better  understanding  of  mental  disorders.The  absence  of  bio-medical literature   with   annotated   RDoC   categories(called  ”constructs”)  limits  the  full  potential of RDoC. It is infeasible to manually analyze every  biomedical  article  for  critical  insights, thereby  explaining  the  importance  of  annotating biomedical literature using RDoC constructs. We aim at exploring different classical ml based and neural network based approaches to rank all abstracts and to extract the most relevant sentence for a given construct.
